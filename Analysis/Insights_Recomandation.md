### Recommendations

1. **Influencer Tier Strategy**
   - **Micro-influencers (1K-10K)**: Focus on ROI-driven campaigns, offer affiliate programs
   - **Mid-tier (10K-100K)**: Deploy for co-branded content and collaborative campaigns

## 5. Advertising & Monetization Optimization

### Key Insights

**Campaign Performance Analysis**
- Retargeting campaigns targeting Heavy Lurker/Socializer segment show highest ROAS (5.93) and lowest CPA ($5.87)
- Strong creative themes (e.g., food-focused content to influencers) generate high CTR but require conversion optimization
- Dormant user reactivation campaigns prove highly inefficient (CPA $37.50, ROAS 0.33)

**Ad Effectiveness Factors**
- ROAS is definitive success metric over CTR or engagement volume
- Audience segment targeting outperforms demographic-only approaches
- Campaign fatigue occurs predictably; creative rotation essential for sustained performance

### Recommendations

## 6. Retention & Reactivation Strategy

### Key Insights

**Inactivity Patterns**
- User disengagement typically begins weeks before complete inactivity
- Heavy creators who become inactive represent highest impact loss to platform vitality
- Majority of inactive users were never consistent creators (passive consumers who lost interest)

**Reactivation Triggers**
- FOMO-based messaging outperforms generic "come back" notifications
- Behavioral triggers (friend posts, new followers, tag memories) drive higher return rates
- Timing and relevance of reactivation attempts critical to success

### Recommendations

1. **Personalized Reactivation Journeys**
   - **For Creators**: "Your followers miss you" + performance data from last post
   - **For Lurkers**: "Trending content in your favorite topics" + specific tag highlights
   - **For Low-engagement Users**: Offer algorithmic boost for next post

2. **Behavioral Trigger System**
   - Deploy automated notifications when user's friend posts
   - Send engagement alerts when user receives new followers after inactivity
   - Create anniversary/memory prompts using tagged content history
